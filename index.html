            <p>I've been programming for fun since high school, and have worked on many projects. Here are a selection
                of
                them: </p>

            <p>Unleash your inner beast in Lunar Haze as Lycan the werewolf. Dodge the villagers'
                hunt, build your power under the veil of night, and fight for supremacy in a heart-racing midnight
                battle.

                Served as the software lead, developed for the <a
                    href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3152/2023sp/">Introduction to Game Design</a> course at
                Cornell University. The project, completed over a semester, involved a team of twelve and was built
                using Java with LibGDX. </p>
            <p>I applied methods in game physics, artificial intelligence, and computer
                graphics to enrich the overall functionality and design of the project.
            </p>
            <p>As the lead, I undertook the responsibility of architecting the technical framework, distributing task
                assignments, and offering guidance to team members as they encountered technical challenges.</p>

            <p>Terrapainter is an application which converts a user-painted heightmap into 3D terrain. The essence of
                the application: you paint a heightmap, hit space, and pretty a 3D island is generated
                for you to explore.

                This project was a collaborative effort within a team of four, as a final project for the Computer
                Graphics Practicum course at Cornell University. Built on top of C++20 and OpenGL 4.5, one of our main
                goals was to understand the complexity of the realtime graphics pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>My focuses included interfacing with OpenGL, terrain generation, and lighting. </p>

            <h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
            <p>I have a few projects within the realm of Computer Graphics, a field that has intrigued me deeply since I
                first delved into programming (it actually was the reason I started!):

                    <h4>Shaders</h4>
                    <p>I've created a couple of shaders ‚Äì functions which returns a color given a pixel as input.
                        Despite their simplicity, these shaders have the power to create neat images. Check out one of
                        my creations below (click to zoom):</p>

            <p>A clone of tetris, created in a team of four for a functional programming class. Written entirely in

                I concentrated on the overall game logic, covering the single-player, player-vs-bot, and
                player-vs-player modes. Further, implementing the intricacies of Tetris movement along with the garbage
                and scoring systems.
